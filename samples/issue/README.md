## Responsive Layouts

This card utilizes our responsive framework, allowing for multiple layouts or content modifications for specific set width ranges. For more details on coding with this framework, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format?tabs=adaptive-md%2Cdesktop%2Cconnector-html#adaptive-card-responsive-layout">Design responsive Adaptive Cards</a>.

## 1) üë©‚Äçüé® Personalize This Card

### Step-by-step instructions and tips

#### 1) Copy the card JSON into the Designer Tool

Teams provides support for this tool, which is ideal for constructing and modifying cards. Copy the [card](card.json) payload and click on the <b>‚ÄòOpen in Designer‚Äô</b> button to start working in the Designer platform.

> [!NOTE]
> Responsive layout is not supported in the Designer.

_To create a "full width" card, add the following code to the JSON._ <br>

```json
"msTeams": {
  "width": "full"
}
```

</a>

 <br>

#### 2) Connect to Relevant Web Addresses

Ensure that the primary path name is correctly hyperlinked to the corresponding project or issue details for easy navigation.

#### 3) Imagery Update and Verification

Please substitute the current 28x28 pixel square image. In the event of crafting a new image, ensure it is saved as a transparent PNG at double the size while maintaining a 16x16 pixel fixed width. Establish the correct pathways to source the avatar image, which should be 20x20 pixels, and incorporate or retrieve any necessary icons for the status sections, which are 16x16 pixels within a 20x20 pixel framework.

<b>Note:</b> It‚Äôs important to conduct tests on any icons to verify their visibility and clarity in both light and dark interface themes.

#### 4) Update Button Copy and Actions

Customize button text and actions to suit your needs. <br>
For icons, use the color #818181 to ensure readability in light/dark modes. Icons should fit edge-to-edge in a 16x16 square. Save them as transparent PNGs at 2x size for good resolution across endpoints. Access Fluent icon asset links in the [Resources section](#resources--tools) on this page.

 ***For further design modifications** use the Microsoft Teams UI Kit in Figma to create, visualize, spec <a href="assets/issueCard_spec.png">(see current card spec)</a> , and verify the layouts before coding.<br />

</a>
<br>

## 2) üöó Test Your Card

This is where the rubber meets the road to ensure high quality cards for all users across all endpoints. Road test your cards considering the following:

* <b>Themes:</b> Light Mode, Dark Mode, High Contrast
* <b>Common widths:</b> Chat, Channel, Meeting Chat, Phone (iOS- Portrait/landscape, Android-Portrait/landscape), Tablet (iOS- Portrait/landscape, Android-Portrait/landscape)
* <b>Accessibility:</b> Color contrast if creating new visuals, tabbing with keyboard or mobile equivelents, Voice assistance (readers to read card content)
