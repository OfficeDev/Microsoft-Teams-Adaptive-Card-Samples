## Responsive Layouts

This card utilizes our responsive framework, allowing for multiple layouts or content modifications for specific set width ranges. For more details on coding with this framework, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format?tabs=adaptive-md%2Cdesktop%2Cconnector-html#adaptive-card-responsive-layout">Design responsive Adaptive Cards</a>.

## 1) üë©‚Äçüé® Personalize This Card

### Step-by-step instructions and tips

#### 1) Copy the card JSON into the Designer Tool

Teams provides support for this tool, which is ideal for constructing and modifying cards. Copy the [card](card.json) payload and click on the <b>‚ÄòOpen in Designer‚Äô</b> button to start working in the Designer platform.

_To create a "full width" card, add the following code to the JSON._ <br>

```json
"msTeams": {
  "width": "full"
}
```

</a>

#### 2) Replace the Hero Image

If you‚Äôre creating an image, use a 16:9 aspect ratio. Save the image as a transparent PNG at 2x size to ensure good resolution across endpoints. <b>Note:</b> You can add a radius to the image in the Designer to create slightly rounded edges.

* For YouTube, Vimeo, and DailyMotion Inline Media Cards, the ‚Äúplay‚Äù button will not need to be added.
* Update the image URL to link to your desired image and specify the URL for the selection action.

#### 3) Connect to the Author Image

Update and verify that the image URL retrieves and displays the author‚Äôs image along with the accurate name.

#### 4) Update Video Description

Update the copy to capture the information and description for your video.

#### 4) Update Button Copy and Actions

Customize button text and add or remove actions to suit your needs. <br>
If you wish to use icons in your button, you can choose from thousands of options in our Fluent icon library. Refer to the [Resources section](#resources--tools) on this page. 
<br>

<b>Note:</b> For other icons, use the color #818181 to ensure readability in both light and dark modes, or choose a color that you have verified looks good. Icons should fit edge-to-edge within a 16x16 square. Save them as transparent PNGs at 2x size for optimal resolution across different endpoints.
<br>

***For further design modifications** use the Microsoft Teams UI Kit in Figma to create, visualize, spec <a href="assets/video_spec.png">(see current card spec)</a> , and verify the layouts before coding.<br />

</a>

## 2) üöó Test Your Card

This is where the rubber meets the road to ensure high quality cards for all users across all endpoints. Road test your cards considering the following:

* <b>Themes:</b> Light Mode, Dark Mode, High Contrast
* <b>Common widths:</b> Chat, Channel, Meeting Chat, Phone (iOS- Portrait/landscape, Android-Portrait/landscape), Tablet (iOS- Portrait/landscape, Android-Portrait/landscape)
* <b>Accessibility:</b> Color contrast if creating new visuals, tabbing with keyboard or mobile equivelents, Voice assistance (readers to read card content)
