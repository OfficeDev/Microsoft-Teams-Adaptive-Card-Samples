## Responsive Layouts

This card utilizes our responsive framework, allowing for multiple layouts or content modifications for specific set width ranges. For more details on coding with this framework, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format?tabs=adaptive-md%2Cdesktop%2Cconnector-html#adaptive-card-responsive-layout">Design responsive Adaptive Cards</a>.

## 1) üë©‚Äçüé® Personalize This Card

### Step-by-step instructions and tips

#### 1) Copy the card JSON into the Designer Tool

Teams provides support for this tool, which is ideal for constructing and modifying cards. Copy the [card](card.json) payload and click on the <b>‚ÄòOpen in Designer‚Äô</b> button to start working in the Designer platform.

_To create a "full width" card, add the following code to the JSON._ <br>

```json
"msTeams": {
  "width": "full"
}
```

</a>

 <br>

#### 2) Replace the Hero Images

If you‚Äôre creating an image, save the image as a transparent PNG at 2x size to ensure good resolution across endpoints. Keep the image small and square to leave ample room for the copy. Add a "Play" button graphic on top of video representations (included in assets folder). <b>Note:</b> You can add a radius to the image in the Designer to create slightly rounded edges.

#### 3) Link to Associated Content

Point to the appropriate URL from the content blocks.

#### 4) Update Description Copy and Set Truncation

Keep the descriptions small if possible, and set the maximum line truncation if needed to work for the card content and layout.  

#### 5) Update Button Copy and Actions
Customize button text and add or remove actions to suit your needs. <br>
If you wish to use icons in your button, you can choose from thousands of options in our Fluent icon library. Refer to the [Resources section](#resources--tools) on this page. 
<br>

<b>Note:</b> For other icons, use the color #818181 to ensure readability in both light and dark modes, or choose a color that you have verified looks good. Icons should fit edge-to-edge within a 16x16 square. Save them as transparent PNGs at 2x size for optimal resolution across different endpoints.
<br>

***For further design modifications** use the Microsoft Teams UI Kit in Figma to create, visualize, spec, and verify the layouts before coding.<br />

</a>

## 2) üöó Test Your Card

This is where the rubber meets the road to ensure high quality cards for all users across all endpoints. Road test your cards considering the following:

* <b>Themes:</b> Light Mode, Dark Mode, High Contrast
* <b>Common widths:</b> Chat, Channel, Meeting Chat, Phone (iOS- Portrait/landscape, Android-Portrait/landscape), Tablet (iOS- Portrait/landscape, Android-Portrait/landscape)
* <b>Accessibility:</b> Color contrast if creating new visuals, tabbing with keyboard or mobile equivelents, Voice assistance (readers to read card content)
