## Responsive Layouts

This card utilizes our responsive framework, allowing for multiple layouts or content modifications for specific set width ranges. For more details on coding with this framework, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format?tabs=adaptive-md%2Cdesktop%2Cconnector-html#adaptive-card-responsive-layout">Design responsive Adaptive Cards</a>.

## 1) üë©‚Äçüé® Personalize This Card

### Step-by-step instructions and tips

#### 1) Copy the card JSON into the Designer Tool

Teams provides support for this tool, which is ideal for constructing and modifying cards. Copy the [card](card.json) payload and click on the <b>‚ÄòOpen in Designer‚Äô</b> button to start working in the Designer platform.

_To create a "full width" card, add the following code to the JSON._ <br>

```json
"msTeams": {
  "width": "full"
}
```

</a>

#### 2) Replace the Hero Image

If you‚Äôre creating an image, use a 16:9 aspect ratio. Save the image as a transparent PNG at 2x size to ensure good resolution across endpoints.

* Update the image URL to link to your desired image and specify the URL for the selection action. Adjust the image as needed for each responsive layout to display optimally.


#### 3) Update Video Information

Modify the copy as desired.

#### 4) Update Button Copy and inputs

Customize button text and add or remove inputs to suit your needs. <br>

<br>

***For further design modifications** use the Microsoft Teams UI Kit in Figma to create, visualize, spec, and verify the layouts before coding.<br />

</a>

## 2) üöó Test Your Card

This is where the rubber meets the road to ensure high quality cards for all users across all endpoints. Road test your cards considering the following:

* <b>Themes:</b> Light Mode, Dark Mode, High Contrast
* <b>Common widths:</b> Chat, Channel, Meeting Chat, Phone (iOS- Portrait/landscape, Android-Portrait/landscape), Tablet (iOS- Portrait/landscape, Android-Portrait/landscape)
* <b>Accessibility:</b> Color contrast if creating new visuals, tabbing with keyboard or mobile equivelents, Voice assistance (readers to read card content)
