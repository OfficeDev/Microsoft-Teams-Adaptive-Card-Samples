## 1) üë©‚Äçüé® Personalize This Card

### Step-by-step instructions and tips

#### 1) Copy the card JSON into the Designer Tool

Teams provides support for this tool, which is ideal for constructing and modifying cards. Copy the [card](card.json) payload and click on the <b>‚ÄòOpen in Designer‚Äô</b> button to start working in the Designer platform.

_To create a "full width" card, add the following code to the JSON._ <br>

```json
"msTeams": {
  "width": "full"
}
```

</a>

#### 2) Replace the Hero Image

If you‚Äôre creating an image, use a 16:9 aspect ratio. Save the image as a transparent PNG at 2x size to ensure good resolution across endpoints.<b>Note:</b> You can add a radius to the image in the Designer to create slightly rounded edges.

* For YouTube, Vimeo, and DailyMotion Inline Media Cards, the ‚Äúplay‚Äù button will not need to be added.
* Update the image URL to link to your desired image and specify the URL for the selection action.

#### 3) Replace the Author/Company Logo

Replace the 16x16px square image. If creating a new image, save it as a transparent PNG at 2x size (keeping the 16x16 fixed width).

#### 4) Update Description Copy and Set Truncation

Set the maximum line truncation as desired. You can choose to keep or remove the ‚ÄúShow more‚Äù / ‚ÄúShow less‚Äù feature.

#### 5) Update Button Copy and Actions

Customize button text and actions to suit your needs. <br>
For icons, use the color #818181 to ensure readability in light/dark modes. Icons should fit edge-to-edge in a 16x16 square. Save them as transparent PNGs at 2x size for good resolution across endpoints. Access Fluent icon asset links in the [Resources section](#resources--tools) on this page.

<br>

***For further design modifications** use the Microsoft Teams UI Kit in Figma to create, visualize, spec <a href="assets/courseVideoCard_spec.png">(see current card spec)</a> , and verify the layouts before coding.<br />

## 2) üöó Test Your Card

This marks the critical point where we ensure that our cards maintain superior quality for every user on every platform. When conducting a road test for your cards, take into account the following considerations:

* <b>Themes:</b> Ensure compatibility with Light Mode, Dark Mode, and High Contrast settings.
* <b>Common widths:</b> Verify the display across various device widths, including Chat, Channel, Meeting Chat, and devices like Phones (iOS in Portrait/Landscape, Android in Portrait/Landscape) and Tablets (iOS in Portrait/Landscape, Android in Portrait/Landscape).
* <b>Accessibility:</b> When designing new visuals, check for color contrast compliance, ensure smooth navigation using keyboard or mobile equivalents, and confirm that voice assistants can accurately read the card content.
