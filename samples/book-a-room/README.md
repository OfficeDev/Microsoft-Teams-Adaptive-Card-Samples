## Responsive Layouts

This card utilizes our responsive framework, allowing for multiple layouts or content modifications for specific set width ranges. For more details on coding with this framework, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format?tabs=adaptive-md%2Cdesktop%2Cconnector-html#adaptive-card-responsive-layout">Design responsive Adaptive Cards</a>.

## 1) üë©‚Äçüé® Personalize This Card

### Step-by-step instructions and tips

#### 1) Copy the card JSON into the Designer Tool

Teams provides support for this tool, which is ideal for constructing and modifying cards. Copy the [card](card.json) payload and click on the <b>‚ÄòOpen in Designer‚Äô</b> button to start working in the Designer platform.

_To create a "full width" card, add the following code to the JSON._ <br>

```json
"msTeams": {
  "width": "full"
}
```

  <img src="../../assets/open_designer_button.png" width="190" alt="Open in Adaptive Card Designer" />
</a>

#### 2) Replace the Hero Image

If you‚Äôre creating an image, use a 16:9 aspect ratio. Save the image as a transparent PNG at 2x size to ensure good resolution across endpoints.

* For YouTube, Vimeo, and DailyMotion Inline Media Cards, the ‚Äúplay‚Äù button will not need to be added.
* Update the image URL to link to your desired image and specify the URL for the selection action.
* <b>Note:</b> A radius feature for adding rounded corners to the image is coming soon. In the meantime, you can manually add a 6px radius to the corners.

#### 3) Update Video Information

Modify the details or statistics as desired.

#### 4) Update Button Copy and Actions

Customize button text and add or remove actions to suit your needs. <br>
For icons, use the color #818181 to ensure readability in light/dark modes. Icons should fit edge-to-edge in a 16x16 square. Save them as transparent PNGs at 2x size for good resolution across endpoints. Access Fluent icon asset links in the [Resources section](#resources--tools) on this page.

<br>

***For further design modifications** use the Microsoft Teams UI Kit in Figma to create, visualize, spec <a href="assets/videoCard_spec.png">(see current card spec)</a> , and verify the layouts before coding.<br />

</a>

## 2) üöó Test Your Card

This is where the rubber meets the road to ensure high quality cards for all users across all endpoints. Road test your cards considering the following:

* <b>Themes:</b> Light Mode, Dark Mode, High Contrast
* <b>Common widths:</b> Chat, Channel, Meeting Chat, Phone (iOS- Portrait/landscape, Android-Portrait/landscape), Tablet (iOS- Portrait/landscape, Android-Portrait/landscape)
* <b>Accessibility:</b> Color contrast if creating new visuals, tabbing with keyboard or mobile equivelents, Voice assistance (readers to read card content)

## Implementation Details

* We use responsive layout to render different elements depending on the layout width, for example the shorter text in the agreement toggle for narrow layouts or the `Book a Room` tagged container at the top of the card.

* The title of the card is kept in a container that is wrapped in another that has a background image. To maintain clarity, we change the size of the inner container depending on the layot width.

*  We use the `ToggleVisibility` action to show/hide optional form fields; notice also that we're toggling the caret icon as a way to dynamically represent the opened/closed state of the field.

## Resources & Tools ##

* **Learn**: For complete details on how to design and build adaptive cards for your Teams app, visit the Microsoft Teams Learn website pages on  [Design Adaptive Cards for Your Teams App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/design-effective-cards?tabs=design) and [Build Cards](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/what-are-cards) (You can use the [schema explorer](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/) to learn about the structure and options of each element.

* **Design**: Our tools can help you learn Teams patterns and design apps and cards.

  * Design Teams apps and cards with the [The Microsoft Teams UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/916836509871353159), which has core components, templates, and best practices.
 
  * Fluent icons are pre-built into the Designer and support both light and dark modes. You can choose from thousands of ready-to-use icons and select from a set of predefined colors. For more Fluent icon resources, check out [IconCloud](https://iconcloud.design/browse/Fluent%20System%20Library/Fluent%20Regular) or the [Fluent 2 Iconography site](https://fluent2.microsoft.design/iconography). <B>NOTE:</B> If you'd like to create custom icons, they should be saved as .pngs (export at 2x) and colored to ensure they look good in both light and dark modes.

* **Build**: Edit, build, preview, and test cards with our Teams Development Portal [Adaptive Card Designer](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/cards).
