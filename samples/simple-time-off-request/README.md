## Responsive Layouts

This card utilizes our responsive framework, allowing for multiple layouts or content modifications for specific set width ranges. For more details on coding with this framework, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format?tabs=adaptive-md%2Cdesktop%2Cconnector-html#adaptive-card-responsive-layout">Design responsive Adaptive Cards</a>.

## 1) üë©‚Äçüé® Personalize This Card

### Step-by-step instructions and tips

#### 1) Copy the card JSON into the Designer Tool

Teams provides support for this tool, which is ideal for constructing and modifying cards. Copy the [card](card.json) payload and click on the <b>‚ÄòOpen in Designer‚Äô</b> button to start working in the Designer platform.


_To create a "full width" card, add the following code to the JSON._ <br>

```json
"msTeams": {
  "width": "full"
}
```

</a>

#### 2) Replace the Hero Image and Text Overlay

Add the image URL and adjust the background image position for different responsive layouts. Update the overlaid text as needed, ensuring the font color remains ```Dark``` for readability in both light and dark themes.

#### 3) Update Input Fields

Modify the input fields and values to capture the required data.

#### 4) Update Button Copy and Actions

Customize button text and add or remove actions to suit your needs. <br>


<br>

***For further design modifications** use the Microsoft Teams UI Kit in Figma to create, visualize, spec, and verify the layouts before coding.<br />
